            <p class="quote-text">In our investigations, my colleagues and I followed
                 infants across the second six months
                 of life. We've found that when parents showed babies books with 
                 faces or objects that were individually named, they learn more, 
                 generalize what they learn to new situations and show more specialized
                  brain responses.  Early learning 
                   in infancy was also associated with benefits four years later.
